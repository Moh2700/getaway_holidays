# Deployment

# Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository in a Frontend Project

1. Navigate to your frontend project folder in the terminal and initialize a local Git Repository

git init

2. This command will create a .git folder where the details of the repository like remote and username and email are stored.

# Step 2: Configure Git username and password

Set your identity locally for this specific project.

- git config user.name "Your Name"
- git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

To configure globally for your future repositories:

- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
- git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

This step ensures that every commit is linked to your identity.

# Step 3: Create a New Repository on Github

![alt text](./docs/features/newrepo1.png)

![alt text](./docs/features/newrepo2.png)

Click the "+" icon on the top-right corner. Select "New repository".

# create repository

Fill in the repository name (e.g., MyProject), add an optional description, choose Public or Private, and click Create repository.

# How to create a Repository on github

New Repository

Note: Once created, GitHub shows you a few lines of code — copy the one with
![alt text](https://github.com/dummyname/MyProject)

# Step 4: Now Add, Commit and push your Frontend Code

Back to vscode and in your terminal(inside your project folder) enter the the following comands:

- git add .
- git commit -m " added frontend file"
- git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name
- git branch -M master
- git push -u origin main
  This will push your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the GitHub repository.

- Now that your project has been initialized with Git and pushed to GitHub, let’s host it on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository.

# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages turns your GitHub repository into a website. It's an easy way to showcase your projects without needing a separate hosting service. You can create static websites directly from your repositories.

- Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.

- Click on the "Settings" tab.

- Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left-hand menu.

- Under "Source," select the branch you want to publish from (typically main or master), and choose the root folder.

![Landing Page](./deployment/deploystep2.png)

![Landing Page](./deployment/deploystep3.png)

- Selecting the branch and root folder for GitHub Pages.

- Click "Save button"

- How to Get Your GitHub Pages URL
  After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is published. It usually follows this format:

https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>

- How to Update Your GitHub Pages Site
  Every time you push changes to the selected branch in your repository, GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site. Here’s a quick reminder on how to push changes:

- Make changes to your project files.

- Add and commit your changes:

Any changes to the website done locally on vscode will be updated to the existing project on GITHUB pages

- git add .
- git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push the changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

# Bugs

# Project Limitations/Challenges

All the data shown for tours and lectures is being pulled from Json files which are

- tours.json
- lectures.json

In a proper commercial applications the website will be using data directly from a back end database password protected and all the security features on it to protect our data system. But at this precise moment, we are going to be just contented with json files.
Updating json files is a nightmare and it is very difficult to do so because of lack of online security and less protection on the existing data files.
At the moment we are only using volatile memory to do data handling when using the system such as Creating new users, Booking new tours and lectures. They are done locally and saved to memory. But as soon as the user refresh the page everything is lost.
